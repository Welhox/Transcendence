<!-- Request Body
If you want to provide the request body, please add a blank line after the request headers like the POST example in usage, and all content after it will be treated as Request Body. Below are examples of Request Body: -->

POST https://example.com/comments HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/xml
Authorization: token xxx

<request>
    <name>sample</name>
    <time>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT</time>
</request>


POST https://example.com/comments HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "name": "sample",
    "time": "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT"
}


GET https://example.com/comments/1 HTTP/1.1

###

GET https://example.com/topics/1 HTTP/1.1

###

POST https://example.com/comments HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
    "name": "sample",
    "time": "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT"
}


Request Line
The first non-empty line of the selection (or document if nothing is selected) is the Request Line. Below are some examples of Request Line:

GET https://example.com/comments/1 HTTP/1.1

GET https://example.com/comments/1


Query Strings
You can always write query strings in the request line, like:

GET https://example.com/comments?page=2&pageSize=10

Sometimes there may be several query parameters in a single request, putting all the query parameters in Request Line is difficult to read and modify. So we allow you to spread query parameters into multiple lines(one line one query parameter), we will parse the lines in immediately after the Request Line which starts with ? and &, like

GET https://example.com/comments
    ?page=2
    &pageSize=10

Request Headers
The lines immediately after the request line to first empty line are parsed as Request Headers. Please provide headers with the standard field-name: field-value format, each line represents one header. By default REST Client Extension will add a User-Agent header with value vscode-restclient in your request if you don't explicitly specify. You can also change the default value in setting rest-client.defaultHeaders. Below are examples of Request Headers:

User-Agent: rest-client
Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6,zh-CN;q=0.4
Content-Type: application/json

Request Body
If you want to provide the request body, please add a blank line after the request headers like the POST example in usage, and all content after it will be treated as Request Body. Below are examples of Request Body:

POST https://example.com/comments HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/xml
Authorization: token xxx

<request>
    <name>sample</name>
    <time>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT</time>
